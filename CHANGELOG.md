  [#27](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGenKit/issues/27)
  * The `strings`, `structuredStrings` and `tableName` have been replaced by `tables`, which is an array of string tables, each with a `name` and a `strings` property.
  * For each string, the `params` variable and it's subvariables (such as `names`, `count`, ...) have been replaced by `types`, which is an array of types.
  * `enumName`, `sceneEnumName` and `segueEnumName` have been replaced by `param.enumName`, `param.sceneEnumName` and `param.segueEnumName` respectively. Templates should provide a default value for these in case the variables are empty.

### Internal Changes
